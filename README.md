# Astro

![Astro — quiet company, sharp tools](assets/astro-logo.svg)

Astro turns [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) into a workspace for
agent CLIs such as Claude Code, Codex and Hermes. It is not a fork of kitty's
source code: it is a configuration plus a title-bar extension that runs inside
an unmodified kitty.

## Features

**Meet Astro**

The mascot is based on Astro, a real long-haired brown/grey tabby: tall ears,
a dark forehead M, a pink nose and a cream ruff. In the owner's front-facing
reference, the missing/closed eye is on the viewer's left and the single open
pale green eye is on the viewer's right. The icon and both ASCII cat poses keep
that exact orientation; do not mirror them. The cat stays minimal, without
detailed whiskers or cheek stripes. Its background is a terminal window with
only slightly rounded corners (16px radius on a 512px canvas), a title bar and
a small prompt. The entire cat head sits 24 SVG units lower beneath the title
bar. GNOME palette colors connect the frame and wordmark to the terminal;
the cat retains its natural fur and eye colors.
Reference photographs are personal and are not distributed in this repository.

New Bash terminal panes greet you with a short CPU-only ASCII animation:
First contact, Tabby rain, Constellation, Orbital cat, Cat nap, Zoomies,
Purr waves, Yarn physics, Whisker radar or Stardust. A persistent shuffle bag
shows all ten before repeating, including when several panes open together.
The greeting lasts at most
1.25 seconds, disappears without adding scrollback, and stops as soon as you
type; your input is left in the terminal queue for the shell. Descendant Bash
shells skip the greeting in the same pane. Command shells such as `bash -ic`
start their agent or monitor immediately; their greeting waits until a real
interactive prompt is opened. Direct non-shell command launches,
tiny panes, redirected output and `TERM=dumb` skip it too. Bash remains the
normal login shell, preserving kitty's native shell integration.

```sh
# Disable greetings for terminals started from this environment.
export ASTRO_ANIMATION=off
# Alternatively set `env ASTRO_ANIMATION=off` in kitty.conf.
# REDUCE_MOTION=1 also disables them; NO_COLOR disables their colors.

# List or preview a specific effect (1–10).
python3 ~/.config/kitty/astro_intro.py --list
python3 ~/.config/kitty/astro_intro.py --effect 6 --duration 3
```

**Astro Bash prompt**

The familiar `user@host:path$` layout uses the owner's reference colors:
purple username (`#a76fc1`), grey `@` and colon (`#9a968f`), golden hostname
(`#fabd2f`), a quiet neutral path (`#bebdba`) and a softer gold prompt symbol
(`#caaa68`). These explicit RGB roles affect only the prompt; applications keep
the GNOME Soft ANSI palette and the neutral `#191919` background.
This is scoped to interactive Kitty Bash sessions; other terminals
are unchanged. Readline wrapping and kitty's native shell integration remain
intact. Set `ASTRO_PROMPT=off` to keep your existing prompt; `NO_COLOR` or a dumb
terminal selects a plain prompt. To update an already open Bash shell, run:

```sh
source ~/.config/kitty/astro_prompt.bash
```

**Pane controls in every title bar**

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `+→` / `+↓` | Open a terminal to the right / below in the current directory |
| `▦` | Cycle the pane's group: none → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → none (colored) |
| `\|↔\|` | Give every pane of this group the same width |
| `⇕` | Give every pane of this group the same height |
| copy | Copy the selection |
| `>_` | Copy the last shell command with its output |
| keyboard | Show kitty's keyboard shortcuts in a separate tab |
| zoom | Zoom the pane (stack layout) and back |
| `✕` | Close the pane (asks when a job is running) |

Ordinary `+→` and `+↓` clicks split the clicked pane right or below. Shift-clicking
adds a full-height column at the tab's right edge or a full-width row at its
bottom, respectively, scaling the existing layout while preserving its proportions.
New terminals inherit the clicked pane's working directory. Only the "Codex below"
launcher button is removed; running Codex panes and their title badges remain unchanged.

**Reload without restarting:** press Ctrl+Shift+F5 to reload configuration and
refresh cached pane controls. When upgrading from the previous default binding,
press it twice: the first reload installs the new binding; the second refreshes
the title bars. Existing panes and running jobs remain open.
Reload also releases cached pointer backends, including the earlier Xlib backend,
so native-pointer fixes take effect without restarting the terminal.

- **Groups:** equalizing changes only the panes of the clicked pane's group;
  every other pane keeps its size. On an ungrouped pane the buttons equalize
  the whole tab along that axis only.
- **Folding:** when the title would otherwise be cut, all controls except close
  fold behind `‹`. Click it to unfold; the controls stay open until you click
  the fold button again. Moving the pointer away does not close them.
- **Hover hints:** the title bar describes the control under the pointer.
  Hints are English or German, following the system locale; put `de` or `en`
  into `~/.config/kitty/pane_controls_lang` to pin a language.

**Agent-aware panes**

- Panes running `claude`, `codex` or `hermes` get a neutral GNOME-colored badge
  (✻ Claude, ›_ Codex, ☤ Hermes). Codex session ids give way to the working
  directory.
- `agy` panes show their session's `/rename` title. Astro reads only the title
  annotation associated with that process's open presence lock; renames refresh
  within two seconds, including when several sessions share a directory.
- A red dot marks a pane whose program rang the bell (an agent finished or
  waits for input); `•` marks background output since the pane last had focus.

**Configuration** (`config/kitty.conf`)

- Splits layout with proportional sizing, a 3 × 3 agent workspace session
  (`config/sessions/default.conf`) plus a monitor column.
- GNOME Soft retains GNOME Terminal 3.58.0's color family while blending bright
  highlights up to 15% toward the background and default text by 10%. Already
  dark colors are not dimmed further; modified colors keep at least 4.5:1 contrast
  against the background. The original neutral background `#191919` stays fixed.
  Original and softened palettes are recorded in `tests/fixtures/gnome-palette.json`
  and `tests/fixtures/gnome-soft-palette.json`. Default text is `#bebdba`, with
  GNOME blue `#2a7bde`. No GNOME desktop theme switching is implied.
  Rounded tabs (shown from two tabs on), dimmed inactive panes,
  beam cursor with a short trail, hover-only link underlines.
- Desktop notification when a long shell command finishes in an unfocused
  pane; trailing spaces are stripped when copying from TUIs.
- **Right click:** paste a PNG screenshot copied by Flameshot as a quoted file
  path into the clicked pane; otherwise paste clipboard text. Agent CLIs can
  read the image at that path. This does not emulate a native image attachment.
- **Middle click:** paste the primary text selection, including in mouse-aware
  TUIs. Both mouse bindings take precedence over application mouse handling.
  Ctrl+Shift+V keeps kitty's native clipboard behavior.

Screenshots stay in `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/astro/clipboard` with private
permissions. They are not automatically deleted, so earlier pasted paths keep
working; delete old screenshots there manually when no longer needed. The
clipboard itself is never replaced. PNG extraction requires `wl-paste`
(`wl-clipboard`) in a Wayland desktop, or `xclip` in a pure X11 session.
PNG reads are limited to 64 MiB while streaming, with a five-second deadline;
oversized payloads, data without a PNG signature or unavailable clipboard owners
fall back to native clipboard text.
An incomplete file is removed if writing or closing it fails.

Terminal programs may read the normal system clipboard without a permission
dialog (`clipboard_control ... read-clipboard`). This also includes programs
running remotely over SSH, so only use trusted programs when the clipboard may
contain sensitive data. Reading the primary selection still requires permission;
paste-safety confirmations remain enabled.

## Tests

Run the standard source, shell-syntax and unit checks from the repository root:

```sh
python3 tools/check.py
```

The runner uses kitty's Python runtime for unit tests and clears display variables
for those tests. ShellCheck runs when installed; `--require-shellcheck` makes it
mandatory. Full verification also rebuilds assets in a temporary clone and runs
real mouse input against a private Xvfb, never the owner's desktop:

```sh
python3 tools/check.py --require-shellcheck --assets --integration
```

The asset check needs the system Python with PyGObject, Rsvg, Cairo and fontTools.
The integration check needs Xvfb and libXtst; `--kitty`, `--xvfb` and
`--xvfb-library-path` support private tool installations. It verifies stale X11
IDs, reloads, normal and Shift splits, source directories, existing processes
and layout proportions. It starts no real agent CLIs and touches no desktop
clipboard. GitHub Actions configures the same checks with a checksum-pinned Kitty
0.49.2 binary and a commit-pinned checkout action.
Whitespace checks cover all tracked source, including in a clean CI checkout.

To run only the unit suite directly:

```sh
kitty +runpy 'import unittest; r = unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=2).run(unittest.defaultTestLoader.discover("tests")); raise SystemExit(not r.wasSuccessful())'
```

## Requirements

- Python **3.10+** and Bash for the optional startup greetings; the renderer
  uses only the standard library and does not use the GPU.
- kitty **0.49.2**. The title-bar mouse handler, `Window._title_bar_screen`
  and the splits layout internals are not public APIs; check Astro after every
  kitty upgrade.
- Linux with kitty on X11 (`linux_display_server x11`, also under Xwayland).
  Native Wayland is not yet verified; see [issue #1](https://github.com/itmitalles-de/astro/issues/1).
  Hover hints use checked XCB queries so a stale X11 ID cannot terminate Kitty.
- Optional: Python 3 with [fontTools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools)
  to rebuild the icon font.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/itmitalles-de/astro.git
cd astro
./install.sh
```

The installer copies `config/` into `~/.config/kitty` (or
`$KITTY_CONFIG_DIRECTORY`), backs up replaced files, installs the icon font,
Astro's desktop entry, application icons and `~/.local/bin/astro`. It adds one
managed, Kitty-only source block to `~/.bashrc` (backed up first). It keeps your
shell and aliases unchanged, applies Astro's prompt palette only in Kitty, and
does not modify other terminal emulators. Source files and Bash hook markers are
validated before replacing user files, including write access when the hook needs
an update. An already-current read-only hook requires no write. The update is atomic and preserves
managed-dotfile symlinks, existing permissions and unrelated line endings.
Backup directories are private (0700); failures after installation starts print
their backup location. This is not a full transactional rollback for disk errors.

**Upgrades preserve `sessions/default.conf`**, including your personal pane layout.
The sample workspace is only copied on first installation. To deliberately reset
it to the sample, use `ASTRO_REPLACE_SESSION=1 ./install.sh`; the previous session
is backed up first. No running panes are closed. For a staged
install, set `KITTY_CONFIG_DIRECTORY`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `ASTRO_BIN_DIRECTORY`
and `ASTRO_BASHRC` to staging paths.

Open **Astro** from the application launcher, or run `astro`. At each app
start, the launcher copies the literal `/resume` (without a newline) into the
clipboard and primary selection. Opening another pane or tab does not overwrite
the clipboard again. `astro --help` and `astro --version` do not change either selection.
Each clipboard command has a two-second deadline (override with
`ASTRO_CLIPBOARD_TIMEOUT`); missing GNU `timeout` skips initialization instead of
running an unbounded helper. Clipboard failure never prevents the terminal from opening.
New Kitty processes use `kitty.app.png` as their window icon. Existing processes may
need a restart before their icon changes; no running sessions are closed by
the installer.

## Brand assets

`assets/astro.svg` is the app-icon source; `assets/astro-logo.svg` is the
self-contained wordmark. PNGs are supplied at 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 pixels.
Rebuild them with the system Python and PyGObject, Rsvg and Cairo installed:

```sh
/usr/bin/python3 tools/build_brand.py
```

## Icon font

All controls use one outline icon font, `fonts/AstroPaneControls.ttf`
(private use area U+E900–U+E90E). Edit the paths in
`tools/build_pane_icons.py` and rebuild it with:

```sh
python3 tools/build_pane_icons.py fonts/AstroPaneControls.ttf
```

Without an output argument, the builder writes to this repository's `fonts/`,
not your installed user fonts. The build is reproducible byte for byte for a
given toolchain; `tools/check_assets.py` checks repeated builds and validates the
shipped glyph outlines and metrics without modifying the working tree.
